# Blink-Camera-Motion-Detection-SmartThings-with-IFTTT
SmartThings Blink Camera System integration to enable Motion Detection

This series of device handlers enable the Blink Camera motion detectors for use in SmartThings for alerts, etc.  It is intended as a stop-gap measure since the original integration was deleted.  

#Since two way communications with the camera is not possible, this system is in no way guaranteed as a part of any security system.

#Description:

There are two files included:

1.  Blink System ST-IFTTT.groovy.  This file creates a Blink System device that will allow arming and disarming of the Blink system through IFTTT.
2.  Blink Motion Detector ST-IFTTT.groovy.  This file creates a Blink Motion Sensor device that, when received from IFTTT, will flag that the blink camera or cameras have detected motion.
